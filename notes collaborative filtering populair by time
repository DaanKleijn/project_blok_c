When a product is sold or looked at more than the baseline, a product will be trending.
(test with both and with only sold products to test which is best.)

it has to exceed the baseline by a significant margin before being considered. (1.4x + 50) The 'baseline' is the

    (--> might have to find a solution to test this, seeing as there are no 50 people visiting the site, much less
    looking and buying the same product)
    --> configure: Create a dataset consisting of amount of hits per product per month for a couple of products and
    see which formula gives a desired result.
