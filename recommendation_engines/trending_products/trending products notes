When a product is sold or looked at more than the baseline, a product will be trending.
(test with both and with only sold products to test which is best.)

it has to exceed the baseline by a significant margin before being considered. (1.4x + 50) The 'baseline' is the
modus (could test average also)
    (--> might have to find a solution to test this, seeing as there are no 50 people visiting the site, much less
    looking and buying the same product)
    --> configure: Create a dataset consisting of amount of hits per product per month for a couple of products and
    see which formula gives a desired result.
    ---> validate. Retroactively create recommendations for x amount of dates in the past and try to assess if the
    recommendations are appropriate. Create a fake dataset for one day and assess if that yields appropriate
    recommendations.


a product that is looked at more than the baseline in certain months could be seasonally attractive and would make
a good candidate as recommendation in those months.
it has to exceed the baseline by a significant margin before being considered. (1.4x + 50)
    --> configure: Create a dataset consisting of amount of hits per product per month for a couple of products and
    see which formula gives a desired result.
    --> validate this recommendation by reviewing the products recommendations by season. Gauge if the recommendations
    are appropriate or not. Validate by hand
    --> !! account for months with more traffic in general.
