# Web-shop Recommendation Engine
This project is dedicated to designing a recommendation engine for the op=op voordeelshop web-shop. We have developed
several engines and validated them against each other in order to find the best recommendation engine for this use case. 
We have also written an advice-rapport about this project, the concept version can be found under 
Adviesrapport_Recommendatie_Engine versie 2.docx.
Written by Kasper Sikkema, Daan Kleijn and Susan Bruggeling.
